                    <h4>2- PMKVY</h4>
                    <h5>What is PMKVY ?</h5>
                    <p className="text-justify"><i className="fa fa-caret-right"></i> Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojanais a unique initiative by the Government of India that aims to offer 24 lakh Indian youth meaningful, industry relevant, skill based training. Under this scheme, the trainees will be offered a financial reward and a government certification on successful completion of training and assessment, which will help them in securing a job for a better future.</p>
                    <h5>ABOUT PMKVY SCHEME</h5>
                    <p className="text-justify"><i className="fa fa-caret-right"></i> Currently, only a very small proportion of India’s workforce has any formal skill training. Not surprisingly therefore several sectors of the country’s economy face shortage of skilled people and are mired with low productivity levels due to poor quality of workforce. At the same time, large sections of the country’s youth are looking for economic and livelihood opportunities. In this context, skill development has become a key priority area for the country. This is not only essential for economic development, but would help to fulfil youth aspirations for good quality, better paid jobs and self-employment opportunities. This would also enable the country to take advantage of its favorable demographic profile. With a large pool of skilled people, India has an opportunity to become a skill provider for the world, particularly the ageing developed world. Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) is the flagship outcome- based skill training scheme of the new Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship (MSDE). This skill certification and reward scheme aims to enable and mobilize a large number of Indian youth to take up skill training and become employable and earn their livelihood. Under the scheme, monetary reward would be provided to trainees who are successfully trained, assessed and certified in skill courses run by affiliated training providers. This will boost the productivity of the country’s workforce by enabling them to acquire high quality skill training across a range of sectors. It will also bring about a paradigm shift from input-based to outcome-based skill training in the country. It also seeks to significantly scale up skill training activities in the country and enable skill training to happen at a fast pace without compromising quality. Institutional arrangements comprising of the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), Sector Skill Councils (SSCs), Assessing agencies and Training Partners are already in place for implementation of the scheme.</p>
                    <h5>OBJECTIVES OF PMKVY SCHEME</h5>
                    <p className="text-justify"><i className="fa fa-caret-right"></i> The objective of this Scheme is to encourage skill development for youth by providing monetary rewards for successful completion of approved training programs.</p>
                    <p className="text-justify"><i className="fa fa-caret-right"></i> Encourage standardization in the certification process and initiate a process of creating a registry of skills.</p>
                    <p className="text-justify"><i className="fa fa-caret-right"></i> Enable and mobilize a large number of Indian youth to take up skill training and become employable and earn their livelihood.

                    <h5>What is NOS and QP? How do we get access to those?</h5>
                    <p className="text-justify"><i className="fa fa-caret-right"></i> National Occupational Standards (NOSs) specify the standard of performance that an individual must achieve when carrying out a particular activity in the workplace, together with the knowledge and understanding they need to meet that standard consistently. Each NOS defines one key function in a job role. In their essential form, NOSs describe functions, standards of performance and knowledge / understanding. Qualification pack is a set of NOSs, aligned to a job role, called Qualification Packs (QPs), would be available for every job role in each industry sector QPs as on 31st March 2015 are available on the PMKVY website. SSCs would provide updated lists of QPs and NOSs for the Pilot Phase of the Scheme..</p>
                    <h5>How is the Aadhaar number being used for the Scheme?</h5>
                    <p className="text-justify"><i className="fa fa-caret-right"></i> A candidate can get enrolled and trained under PMKVY by providing his/ her mobile number and other alternate IDs such as EPIC (Electors Photo Identity Card) and PAN (Permanent Account Number). The Training Partner must facilitate enrolment of a candidate for Aadhaar. The Aadhaar number is only being used to ensure that a candidate does not avail of the monetary reward more than once during the Scheme.</p>
                    <h5>How can Training Partners open Bank accounts?</h5>
                    <p className="text-justify"><i className="fa fa-caret-right"></i> The banking activity under PMKVY has been classified under the following three points: A. Training Partner can charge Full Fee Upfront A Training Partner is free to charge (and should charge) the complete training fee from the trainee. If the trainee undertakes the Training by paying upfront to the Training Provider, trainee can provide any Bank account details and should not sign any Undertaking and will receive the complete Monetary Reward in their bank account (any bank account which the Trainee provides). B. Training Partners may work with designated Banks for PMKVY In case the Training Partner choses to extend credit to a few students in the batch (it is done at their own discretion), TP can work with the Banks which are designated for PMKVY to open bank accounts with specific Auto-debit facility. Information about the banks shall be communicated with the stakeholders shortly. Please Note, NSDC will not be anytime responsible for any mis-credit/failed Auto-Debit to the TP’s account. The Training Partner has to abide by the Terms & Conditions of the Bank & NSDC to explore this option. C. Training Providers can work with their own Banking Network The Training Partner is free to explore their own Banking arrangements with any Bank (Nationalized/Private) if they do not want to adhere to the terms & conditions laid in step B. In this case the Auto-Debit (if they choose to extend credit) & opening of Zero balance bank accounts will be managed by the Training Providers themselves.</p>
